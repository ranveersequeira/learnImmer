#Dummy PROJECT TO show IMMER Implementation

Why I'm afraid of spread operater and Immutibility in general?
REASON: https://jpcamara.com/2023/03/07/making-tanstack-table.html

Topics:

1. Immutibility
2. React State update ( its nature of object reference)
3. Complex Redux State (its nature to use Immutibility)
4. How Immer benefits in these above scenarios


What you should explore in case you want to deep dive into this topic.
1. Pass by Value and Pass by reference in JS (shallow copy vs. Deep copy)
2. Why do we use js method like .map .filter often instead of foreach and other loping methods
3. React Fiber,React Diffing and React Reconciliation.
